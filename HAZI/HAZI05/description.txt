First, I imported the necessary packages for the project and defined the path to the CSV file. Then, I initialized the class constructor with two class-level variables. I created a property for one of them and also created a static method that imports the CSV file and shuffles the values in the DataFrame with a seed of 42 to randomize them.

Next, I split the DataFrame into two sections: one for the required data and another for the predicted outcome. I also created a Train Test Split method that splits the data into train and test data with a specified percentage to use for the KNN algorithm.

I implemented the Euclidean method to measure the distance between consecutive points and created a predict function that makes predictions based on the given data. The function also sorts the predictions to make them easier to work with.

The accuracy function calculates the accuracy of the program, which is a good indicator of its performance on unknown data. The confusion matrix shows the program's good and bad predictions in a heatmap.

Lastly, I created the best_k_accuracy function, which returns the best k value with the highest accuracy.
